# Astro Locale Routing

This is a demo application that uses Astro to show how easy it is to get up and started with locale based url routing.  It also demonstrates how content is treated as a first class citizen by leveraging the power of Astro's Content Collection API.  The code includes integrations (A.K.A. plugins) for Tailwind, astro-i18next, and react.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog.(md|mdx)
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
